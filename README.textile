h1. Bug Masher for RailsBridge

A simple IRC bot using Autumn to track progress of bugs on lighthouse app

Irc username: masher

To start first make sure you rake @db:migrate@ (the database name is bug_masher)
then you can use @script/server@

h1. requirements

So, off the top of my head, here's what we need:

- Bot that sits in #railsbridge and listens
- Page on the RailsBridge wiki that it maintains
- It may need to be able to hook in to Lighthouse & GitHub as well

- We should be reasonably resilient if people hand-edit the wiki page, but I'd be OK flagging a chunk of the page with "autogenerated, do not touch" markers

- we'll be using the tag "bugmash" in LH to identify tickets that are on the list to be looked at

Commands:

!status 1234
	bot check LH for current status. Potential responses:
		https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1234 is not flagged for this bugmash
		https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1234 is available for bugmashing
Would *love* it if could parse details of the ticket and tell us that it was waiting for confirmation, waiting for a failing test, waiting for a patch
		https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1234 is being worked on by mark[oz] and Radar
(there's no reason we can't have multiple people looking at the same ticket - I don't want us to be a firm traffic cop)

!working 1234
	bot checks LH for current status
		if flagged for this bugmash, add a line to the wiki page "mark[oz] is working on https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1234"
		if not flagged for this bugmash "thanks, that one isn't scheduled for the bugmash but you're still welcome to tackle it"

!confirm 1234
	update the wiki page to indicate that the issue has been confirmed by the user

!addtest 1234
	update the wiki page to indicate that the user has added a test case to the issue

!addpatch 1234
	update the wiki page to indicate that the user has added a patch to the issue

Worth monitoring LH to pick these states up automatically? Probably not in this version
Worth allowing people to add +1 to LH via the bot? Again, I'd guess probably not

That's a rough outline. I'm more than open to innovative ideas. The basic thing I want to do is provide us some repository of who's doing what, and warn people before we end up having 10 people looking at the same bug
